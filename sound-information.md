# Information about FFVIII sound effects

To keep sound names simple, more information about them is written here.

Enemies have a lot of unnamed attacks; for those, I've used the names in [finalfantasy.fandom.com](https://finalfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/). In any case, the name of the enemy is specified before the skill to avoid any confusion.


## Different game versions (pitch changes)

The PSX version of FFVIII changes the pitch of sound effects in real time, while the PC versions do not. For example, on PSX Angelo barks in a higher pitch, Doomtrain's level crossing bell has a raised pitch, Elvoret's death sound effect has a lowered pitch.


## Menus

  - When a wrong number is entered: normally played, then played with higher pitch immediately after.


## Footsteps

```
2 normal footstep 1
3 normal footstep 2
```

These footsteps are used in battle too, for the run leading to physical attacks: Squall, Seifer, Laguna, Ward, Kiros, and G-Soldiers.


## Casting magic

Edea as an enemy uses the party's magic cast sound effect, not the enemies' one.


## Drawing magic

Griever uses the same layered sound effects than the party's for drawing magic, i.e. `115+116+117`

Ultimecia's "Draw Apocalypse" uses the "Drain" sound effect (`793`).


## Party's attacks

Sequences and number of hits:

- `4 Attack Squall 1`: swing
- `158 Attack Squall 2`: slash
- `151 Attack Zell`: **x2**
- `155 Attack Rinoa 1`: throw
- `156 Attack Rinoa 2`: hit
- `160 Attack Quistis 1`: swing **x2**
- `161 Attack Quistis 2`: hit
- `165 Attack Selphie 1`: swing
- `166 Attack Selphie 2`: hit
- `168 Attack Irvine`: **x1**
- `174 Attack Laguna`: **x3**
- `169 Attack Kiros`: **x2**
- `170 Attack Ward 1`: throw
- `171 Attack Ward 2`: hit
- `164 Attack Seifer`: **x1**
- `176 Attack Edea`: **x1**

Gunblade trigger:

- `159 Gunblade shot`: also used during renzokuken, when the trigger is pressed in time.

Squall, Quistis and Ward also use their attack sounds at the start of the battle, with their animation to "get ready" to fight.

- `4 Squall's attack sfx 1`: swinging the Gunblade
- `160 Quistis' attack sfx 1`: swinging the whip
- `161 Quistis' attack sfx 2`: "hitting the air"
- `171 Ward's attack sfx 2`: hitting the ground with its arpion


## Critical hits

Critical hit sounds are played on top of the normal attack sounds. Irvine and Edea can't do critical hits for some reason.

All critical hit sounds are played only once. If the character has multiple hits (e.g. Laguna, who shoots three times), the critical sound effect is layered on top of the last hit.


## Misses

Both for the party and for the enemies, when a physical attack misses, this sound is played:

`31 Attack miss`

However, this doesn't apply for long-range physical attacks, meaning that you are still going to hear the normal sound (e.g. Rinoa, Irvine, Edea, Laguna).

Moreover, some strong monsters like dragons or bosses like the Weapons, are playing their physical attack sound even when it misses.


## Enemies death sound effects

When enemies die, these sounds are played at the same time:

```
13 Enemy death base layer 1
14 Enemy death base layer 2
```

These create the default enemy death sound. Enemy-specific death sounds are all layered on top of these, except bosses, where only their specific sound will play (they generally last longer and are more dramatic). If no enemy-specific sound exists, only the default ones will play (e.g. Galbadian soldiers). Some human bosses don't have a death sfx because they don't actually die (e.g. Fujin and Raijin, Edea).

- `202 Hexadragon`: the sound is repeated three times in the audio file for some reason, but the game only plays the first sound.
- `266 Vysage`: same sound for Righty and Lefty too.
- `281 Jumbo Cactuar`: it's also the sound of its "skill" _Escape_; however, when defeated, it plays on top of the usual `13+14`

## Enemy calls

What I've labeled "enemy calls" are all the intro calls that monsters make when starting a battle. These also include sound effects for human bosses, even though they are not "calls".

Some monster calls are also played during the battle, for example right before the monster is about to perform a particular attack, or when performing some special skill. Below there's a list of all these particular cases.

All intro calls are technically played but only the last monster's call is heard. The order depends on the game version. So, for example, in the Granaldo boss fight, on PC you only hear the Raldo call, while in the PSX version you only hear Granaldo's call.

- `183 Elvoret`: before _Storm Breath_
- `190 X-ATM092 stomps a leg`: **x2** before _Leg Strike_, then **x1**
- `190 X-ATM092 stomps a leg`: **x4** before _Ray-Bomb_
- `190 X-ATM092 stomps a leg`: **x1** before _Arm Crush_, then **x1**
- `193 Snow Lion`: before _Ice Breath_
- `201 Hexadragon`: before _Melt-Eye_
- `203 Fastitocalon`: before _Sand Storm_
- `213 Belhelmel`: Belhelmel's mode change _"Belhelmel is furious!"_ and _"Belhelmel laughed!"_
- `221 Wendigo`: before _Dribble_, and before _Shoot_
- `225 Armadodo`: before _Swipe_
- `229 SAM08G`: special skill _Store_
- `235 Abyss Worm`: special skill _Lift head_
- `241 Ruby Dragon`: before _Claw_
- `259 Oilboyle`: intro call (in the boss fight, played **x2**)
- `259 Oilboyle`: before _Oil Shot_ and before _Oil Blast_
- `261 Iguion`: before _Resonance_
- `263 Forbidden`: special skill _Change stance_
- `278 Cactuar`: special skill _Escaped..._
- `282 Tonberry`: special skill _Walk_
- `294 BGH251F2`: the intro call applies to both encounters

- `336 Sacred`: its intro call applies to both encounters
- `337 Elnoyle`: before _Storm Breath_
- `352 Ultima Weapon`: before _Gravija_
- `355 Granaldo prepares to grab a Raldo`: this call is slightly different from its intro call
- `356 Gayla prepares to attack`: this call is slightly different from its intro call; played before _Head Bash_ and before _Tail Whip_
- Edea (first encounter)'s intro "call": `1783`, i.e. the same sound effect of her skill _Astral Punch_
- `290 Adamantoise`: before _Sand Storm_
- `343 Diablos`: before _Claw_
- `348 Sorceress A`: when a new sorceress appears, **layered** with `1825 Another sorceress appears`
- `350 sorceress_B`: when a new sorceress appears, **layered** with `1825 Another sorceress appears`


## Multiple targets skills: "Once" or "for each"

For skills or items that target all enemies/party (and only for those where it's not obvious by listening to the sound), this list specifies if the sound effect is played once for each target (with a slight delay), or if it is played just once.

## Ultimecia (Final form): attacks

Ultimecia (Final form)'s _Claw_ (ID 4) and _Claw Counterattack_ (ID 156) have the same animation and sound effect, and they always critical. They are basically the same attack but "Claw Counterattack" is weaker and never misses and is exclusively done as a counter-attack to Dispel (which the player may want to cast to remove Ultimecia's Reflect that she casts on herself under certain conditions; what these conditions are is still being investigated).
