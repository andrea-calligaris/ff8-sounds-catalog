# Catalog for the ambience sounds in "music/stream"


`003-combat`:
* Dollet square, war sounds. It starts when you talk to Seifer after defeating all the enemies in the square (Squall: «Sounds like it's starting.»). It pauses in battles, but it doesn't stop until the Biggs and Wedge scene on top of the tower, where the ambience is replaced by "011-wind". This, on PSX. On PC, instead, it's bugged (like most things sound-related on PC), and so it stops as soon as you reach the communications tower up close, for then playing again in case you reload a save inside the tower or after a battle (in the so called "Remastered", instead, only if you load a save).
* Battle of the Gardens, when outside the entrance of Galbadia Garden with Rinoa; it continues inside, until you have to choose the party. If you then go outside it doesn't play again.

`006-funsui`:
* Dollet square fountain, only during the SeeD exam, and only (and immediately) after the last battle in the square. It stops as soon as "003-combat" starts playing.

`010-ante`:
* Inside a stopped train.
* The communications tower running. It starts after the FMV where the tower activates, before the Elvoret fight. It doesn't stop when the player exits the tower, it only lowers the volume a lot. It actually stops once you reach the next screen (after the X-ATM092 fight, where the path makes a turn and you can see the moon in the background).
* Shumi Village: elevator's background ambience, both when still and when moving.

`011-wind`:
* The top of the communications tower, starting with the Biggs and Wedge scene. It stops as soon as the FMV ends, and "010-ante" replaces it.
* Galbadia desert scenario after escaping from the prison.
* Missile Base, outside, only when arriving.
* Fishermans Horizon, first visit, outside Balamb Garden's deck, until the FH music starts.
* Fishermans Horizon, factory, hidden area where there's the old fisherman for the side-quest.

`030-Flangchorus`:
* Disc 2, Edea in the auditorium, once the player starts the cutscene by reaching near the hidden draw point. The sound file doesn't loop.

`034-chorus`:
* Flashback of the orphanage: Edea's identity is revealed. The sound file doesn't loop.

`037-reet`:
* Fire Cavern: the last two screens.

`038-soyo`:
* Very start of the game, in the infirmary; it holds through Quistis' FMV.
* Balamb Garden dormitory, morning of the first SeeD job. As soon as you enter the dormitory corridor, it stops, and it doesn't activate again even if you re-enter the dormitory; it also doesn't play again if you load the save.
* Balamb Garden dormitory, morning after the Garden starts moving, when Rinoa comes to Squall's room (if not sent to the missile base); the sound has the same behavior as for the morning of the first SeeD job.
* Balamb Garden dormitory, after Ellone goes away on the White SeeDs ship.
* Balamb Garden dormitory, after the FH concert. This time it stops as soon as Squall gets up from the bed.
* Shumi Village: the "fake outside" of the underground village.

`039-rouka`:
* Very start of the game, outside the infirmary, until the Garden introductory FMV.
* The forest before Galbadia Garden, but only after waking up from the second Laguna dream.

`040-night`:
* Dormitory, before the SeeD party.
* After the SeeD party: it's the whole Balamb Garden, with different volume levels. Low in the dormitory, very high outside (dormitory corridor), very low in the main hall and the Training Center corridor. **Not** playing in the Training Center. **Not** present in the secret area.
* Caraway's mansion (low volume).
* Dormitory, the night of the concert. Higher volume in the corridor, which continues to FH. It stops when the concert starts.
* Dormitory, when Quistis presents herself as the CC King.

`044-sea`:
* Balamb harbor, including the screen outside the hotel.
* Balamb Garden Quad, when it's sailing the sea.
* Fishermans Horizon, last screen of the dock, where there's the kid and the shopkeeper.
* Fishermans Horizon, residential area's plaza, when the mayor attempts to reason with the Galbadian soldier.
* Fishermans Horizon, residential area's plaza, after the other team came back, and Rinoa talks to Squall privately.
* Fishermans Horizon, residential area outside the shop/hotel, when finishing the old fisherman side-quest.

`074-train`:
* Inside any train when it's moving, except the Forest Owls' one. And **not** in any part of the kidnapping mission.

`086-mdmotor`:
* Unused duplicate of "087-mdmotor"

`087-mdmotor`:
* MD level, the lowest level, i.e. the last three screens (last screen being a different camera angle of the second-to-last).

`094-laswhite`:
* End of Disc 2, Ultimecia possesses Rinoa. The player hears it for a very short time, because soon there comes the save file menu.
