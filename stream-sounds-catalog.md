# Catalog for the ambience sounds in "music/stream"


`003-combat`:
* Dollet square, war sounds. It starts when you talk to Seifer after defeating all the enemies in the square (Squall: «Sounds like it's starting.»). It pauses in battles, but it doesn't stop until the Biggs and Wedge scene on top of the tower, where the ambience is replaced by "011-wind". This, on PSX. On PC, instead, it's bugged (like most things sound-related on PC), and so it stops as soon as you reach the communications tower up close, for then playing again in case you reload a save inside the tower or after a battle (in the so called "Remastered", instead, only if you load a save).

`006-funsui`:
* Dollet square fountain, only during the SeeD exam, and only (and immediately) after the last battle in the square. It stops as soon as "003-combat" starts playing.

`010-ante`:
* Inside a stopped train.
* The communications tower running. It starts after the FMV where the tower activates, before the Elvoret fight. It doesn't stop when the player exits the tower, it only lowers the volume a lot. It actually stops once you reach the next screen (after the X-ATM092 fight, where the path makes a turn and you can see the moon in the background).

`011-wind`:
* The top of the communications tower, starting with the Biggs and Wedge scene. It stops as soon as the FMV ends, and "010-ante" replaces it.

`037-reet`:
* Fire Cavern: the last two screens.

`038-soyo`:
* Very start of the game, in the infirmary; it holds through Quistis' FMV.
* Balamb Garden dormitory, morning of the first SeeD job. As soon as you enter the dormitory corridor, it stops, and it doesn't activate again even if you re-enter the dormitory.

`039-rouka`:
* Outside the infirmary, until the Garden introductory FMV.
* The forest before Galbadia Garden, but only after waking up from the second Laguna dream.

`040-night`:
* Dormitory, before the SeeD party.
* After the SeeD party: it's the whole Balamb Garden, with different volume levels. Low in the dormitory, very high outside (dormitory corridor), very low in the main hall and the Training Center corridor. **Not** playing in the Training Center. **Not** present in the secret area.
* Caraway's mansion (low volume).

`044-sea`:
* Balamb harbor, including the screen outside the hotel.

`074-train`:
* Inside any train when it's moving, except the Forest Owls' one. And **not** in any part of the kidnapping mission.
