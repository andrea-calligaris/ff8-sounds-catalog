# Final Fantasy VIII sounds catalog


This is a WIP catalog with descriptive names and additional information about the sounds in Final Fantasy VIII.

The ID numbers go from 1 to 2789 (field ID from 7851 to 10639), with a lot of IDs empty / available for modding, for a total of 1'543 used sound effects. To obtain the field ID number you can add 7850 to the ID.

For modding you can use [FF8Audio](https://forums.qhimm.com/index.php?topic=14944.0) by _Shard_ (it uses the field ID), or the newer [FF8SND](https://github.com/julianxhokaxhiu/FF8SND) by _Julian Xhokaxhiu_.

All text files are _LF_.

In [catalog.txt](catalog.txt) there's the list of sound files in this format:

`ID	category → sub category → descriptive name`

In [sound-information.md](sound-information.md) you can find additional information about the sound effects; for example, by which monsters a shared attack sfx is used.

For the ambience sounds in `music/stream`, see [stream-sounds-catalog.md](stream-sounds-catalog.md).
